<!-- Describe task in general -->

<p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_leg">Ghost leg</a> is a well-known method used to get random results.
    This mechanism has the effect of changing the order in the list.
</p>
<p>
    This mission is almost reversed the <a href="https://py.checkio.org/mission/follow-ghost-legs-2/">Follow Ghost Legs</a>.
    But this mission has countless answers and asymmetric in difficulty.
    So You should solve the <a href="https://py.checkio.org/mission/follow-ghost-legs-2/">Follow Ghost Legs</a> first.
</p>

    <img title="example_01" src="{{MEDIA}}draw_ghost_legs_example_02.svg" alt="example_02" style="vertical-align:top; width:250px;"/>
</p>

<p>
    You are given a list of result for that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_leg">Ghost leg</a> as input values.
    The starting value is always sequentially numbered from 1. You have to return the list of legs that match them.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>The leg is a tuple of two integers, which represent the two vertical lines connected by the leg.
        (The leg always connects adjacent vertical line).</li>
    <li>The order of legs represents the level at which they are placed (first leg is the top, and last leg is the bottom).</li>
</ul>
<p>Your answer will be confirmed by the checker.</p>

<p>
    <strong>Examples:</strong>
</p>

<pre class="brush: {% if is_js %}javascript{% else %}python{% endif %}">
def checker(func: callable, result: list[int]):
    your_result = [r for r in sorted(result)]
    for a, b in func(result):
        your_result[a - 1], your_result[b - 1] = your_result[b - 1], your_result[a - 1]
    return your_result == result


assert checker(draw_ghost_legs, [3, 2, 1]) is True              # [(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 2)] etc.
assert checker(draw_ghost_legs, [3, 2, 4, 1]) is True           # [(2, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)] etc.
assert checker(draw_ghost_legs, [1, 5, 4, 2, 3]) is True        # [(3, 4), (4, 5), (3, 4), (2, 3), (3, 4)] etc.
assert checker(draw_ghost_legs, [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1]) is True     # [(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (5, 6)] etc.
